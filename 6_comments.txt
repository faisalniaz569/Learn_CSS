## comments

CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are ignored by browsers.

A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:

Example:

Html:

<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>


Css:

/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red; /* Set text color to red */
} 


Example 2:

Html:

<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>

Css:

/* This is
a multi-line
comment */

p {
  color: red;
} 


From the HTML tutorial, we learn html comments <!-- -->

In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:

Example 3:

Html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
  color: red; /* Set text color to red */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>My Heading</h2>

<!-- These paragraphs will be red -->
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>HTML and CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>

</body>
</html>
