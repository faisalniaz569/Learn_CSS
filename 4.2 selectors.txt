** CSS Combinators

A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

1. descendant selector (space)
2. child selector (>)
3. adjacent sibling selector (+)
4. general sibling selector (~)


# Descendant Selector

The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements: 

Example 1:

Html:

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
  <section><p>Paragraph 3 in the div.</p></section>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 4. Not in a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 5. Not in a div.</p>

Css:

div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}



# Child Selector

The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

Example 2:

Html:

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
  <section>
    <!-- not Child but Descendant -->
    <p>Paragraph 3 in the div (inside a section element).</p>
  </section>
  <p>Paragraph 4 in the div.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 5. Not in a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 6. Not in a div.</p>


Css:

div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}


# Adjacent sibling selector

The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".


Html:

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 3. After a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4. After a div.</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 5 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 6 in the div.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 7. After a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 8. After a div.</p>

Css:

div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}



# General sibling selector

The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements: 

Html:

<p>Paragraph 1.</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 3.</p>
<code>Some code.</code>
<p>Paragraph 4.</p>

Css:

div ~ p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
