CSS has several different units for expressing a length.

Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {
  font-size: 60px;
}

p {
  font-size: 25px;
  line-height: 50px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


## Absolute Lengths

cm	centimeters
mm	millimeters
in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px *	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc  picas (1pc = 12 pt)


## Relative Lengths

em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
ch	Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	
vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
%	Relative to the parent element
